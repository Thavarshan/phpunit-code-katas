# Katas

Kata is a martial arts term from Japan that refers to a choreographed sequence of movements. The goal is to perfect and internalize these movements through repetition and memorization. Once mastered, these sequences serve as a reference guide that you can instantly reach for and adapt without thought.

Outside of martial arts, this word, kata, is used more generally to refer to any set of steps or patterns that is repeated until mastery. Think of it as a way to harness your form and routine.
